I went to the moped store said "screw it"
Salesman's like "What up what's your budget"
And I'm like "Honestly I don't know nothing about mopeds"
He said "I got the one for you follow me"
Ooh it's too real
Chromed out mirror I don't need a windshield
Banana seat a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed
Downtown cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up moped to the valet
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope my crew is ill and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'mma lick that stick that break her off Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage you don't need a wristband
Dope!
Killing the game 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland Khaled Scott Storch Birdman
Goddamn man everybody got Bugattis
But I'mma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody hella raw pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather alright I'm lying it's pleather
But girl we could still ride together oh
You don't need an Uber you don't need a cab
screw a bus pass you got a moped man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place throwing fish to a player
Downtown downtown downtown
Downtown downtown downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep her safe
Downtown
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
Downtown
Of a leather seat between your legs
Hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey
Downtown
You don't want no beef boy
Know I run the streets boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown
Dope!
Cut the bullscrew
Get off my mullet
Stone washed so raw
Moped like a bullet oh yee-ow
You can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
'Cause I'm too damn quick I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out "Who that is"
It's me the M the A-C the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean water ski ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello but baby the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl I got two wheels
She a big girl but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like "You need to slow down"
"Going thirty-eight Dan chill the screw out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down"
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you give it to you
Cruising down Broadway girl what a wonderful view wonderful view
There's layers to this screw player tiramisu tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit tearing my suit
Downtown downtown downtown
Downtown downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep her safe
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
Of a leather seat between your legs
Downtown
You don't want no beef boy
Know I run the streets boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown
You don't want no beef boy
Know I run the streets boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown
